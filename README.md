FR3DLdapBundle
==============

OPENVIEW note: this fork has been made to solve some problems we had with the legacy driver.

The FR3DLdapBundle adds support for provide and/or authenticate users with a
LDAP Directory in Symfony2.

It's mainly developed thinking in unmanaged corporate LDAP directories so you
could retrieve users from LDAP and manage them using `FOSUserBundle` features
(role management, guess users registration, etc).

Features include:

**Features included:**

- Works with with [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/)
- Customizable and extensible
- Unit tested

**Note:** This bundle cannot work as standalone at this moment and requires an User Manager (For ex: `FOSUserBundle`)

**Versions and compatibilities:**

- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle.png?branch=1.5.x)](http://travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle) `1.5.x` is compatible with Symfony 2.0.x and is recommended for stable projects.
- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle.png?branch=1.6.x)](http://travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle) `1.6.x` is compatible with Symfony 2.1.x and has the same features than 1.5.x
- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle.png?branch=2.0.x)](http://travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle) `2.0.x` is compatible with Symfony 2.1.x and has new features. This version is actually under development and is subject to changes.
- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle) `Master` is, at this moment, synced with 1.5.x but I encourage fix your installation to the 1.5.x version branch unless you like the risk.
